# metasnatch
iHeart Radio Metadata Grabber
-- Written in Python

-----------------------------

So I was using Tizonia to listen to iHeart radio
but I noticed that it doesn't tell me what's playing.
Like any sensible person, I decided to do it myself

-----------------------------

Currently
- Functions as needed
- Paths are hardcoded
- Because paths are hardcoded, it only works for Full Metal Jackie

TODO
- Pull data from any iHeart radio station
- Pull radio station data
