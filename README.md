iHeart Radio Metadata Grabber
-- Written in Python

-----------------------------

So I was using Tizonia to listen to iHeart radio
but I noticed that it doesn't tell me what's playing.
Like any sensible person, I decided to do it myself

-----------------------------

Currently
- Functions as needed
- You can freely choose your radio station (As long as it pulls data from api.iheart.com)
- No protections for entering the wrong ID

TODO
- Pull radio station data
- Fix all cases where iHeart doesn't pull metadata from api.iheart.com
