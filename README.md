iHeart Radio Metadata Grabber
-- Written in Python

-----------------------------

So I was using Tizonia to listen to iHeart radio
but I noticed that it doesn't tell me what's playing.
Like any sensible person, I decided to do it myself

-----------------------------

Currently
- You can freely choose your radio station
- Uses the song history from iHeart's API to work globally across all stations

TODO
- Pull radio station data
- Add Station search so we aren't relying on IDs
